Task 3 WHich is (Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression)
The goal of my Task is to analyze and predict the median house value based on various features related to houses in a California district.
Data Source: The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, and it contains information about houses based on the 1990 census data. The columns include features such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity.
Context: The data is not cleaned, so preprocessing steps are required to handle missing values and scale the features appropriately.
Task Steps:

Data Loading:

The dataset from Kaggle is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations are created to explore the distribution of median income with house value.
A count plot is generated to visualize the distribution of house value bins in the dataset.
A boxplot is created to observe the median house value at different ocean proximity categories.
A scatter plot is used to visualize the geographical distribution of houses based on longitude and latitude.

Data Preprocessing:

Binning is performed on the 'median_house_value' column to create categorical bins for analysis.
Imputation of missing values is done using the median strategy, and the data is scaled using StandardScaler.
Feature Engineering:

New features like 'rooms_per_household', 'bedrooms_per_rooms', and 'population_per_household' are created.
Correlation analysis is conducted to understand the relationship between features and the target variable.
Data Splitting:

The data is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split method.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Linear Regression is used to train the model on the training set.
Cross-validation is employed to evaluate the model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
Predictions are made on both the training set and the test set, and RMSE is calculated.
Conclusion:

The project involves loading, exploring, and visualizing the California housing dataset.
Preprocessing steps include handling missing values and scaling features.
Feature engineering is performed to create new relevant features.
The data is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
Linear Regression is used for predicting median house values.
The RMSE metric is employed for model evaluation.
